        Enforce Int

        Enforces that the given numeric value is an int.  If the value is a float it
        will be converted to an int and returned.  If it is already an int it will
        be returned directly.  If it is anything else an exception will be raised.

        Arguments
        ---------
        name : str
            Name of the value being tested.  This name is used in the exception if
            it is raised.
        value : int | float
            Value that must be or will be converted to an int.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            The input value if it was an int, or the value converted to an int if it
            was a float.
