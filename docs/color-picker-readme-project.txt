##  NEW INSTALL
##

1. Create a new directory under your Ren'Py directory.
2. Unpack this zip file into that new directory.
3. Enjoy!

1. Create a backup copy of your project directory (in case anything goes wrong).
2. Unpack this zip file into your project's root directory (the directory one
   above the game directory).
3. If you are unzipping from the "project" zip file rather than the "slim" zip
   file, overwrite any conflicting files.
4. Verify everything is working as intended.
5. Remove your project backup if desired.


##
##  UPDATING
##

The "project" zip is not suitable for updating.  If you started your project
from the "project" zip, updating should be done with the "slim" zip instead.
