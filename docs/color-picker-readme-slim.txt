2. Unpack this zip file into your project's root directory (the directory one
   above the "game" directory).
3. If you are unzipping from the "project" zip file rather than the "slim" zip
   file, overwrite any conflicting files.
4. Verify everything is working as intended.
5. Remove your project backup if desired.
