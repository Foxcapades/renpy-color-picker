### Playable Demo

For a playable demonstration of the color picker, please download the
`lib-color-picker` file for your operating system.  This file can be unpacked
and played like any other Ren'Py game.

### Project Starter

1. Download the color picker `project.zip` file.
2. Create a new directory under your Ren'Py directory.
3. Unpack the `project.zip` file into that new directory.
4. Open up the Ren'Py launcher, and your new starter project should appear in
   the project list.

### Just the Code

1. Download the color picker `slim.zip` file.
2. Unpack the `slim.zip` file into your target project's root directory (the
   directory one above the "game" directory).
